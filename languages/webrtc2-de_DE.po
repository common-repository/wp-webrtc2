"to user browser requests. Plugin once a day automatically checks each of "

"connection to the TURN server and relaying all information through this "
"server. The first node makes a connection to the TURN server and tells the "
"other node to send packets to this server, which will then be forwarded to "
"the first node. Obviously they come with some overhead, so this is only used "
